        Hello there, I am Protik Chanda, a tech enthusiast with a keen interest
        in computers, softwares, communication, well-being, education and
        innovation of any type overall. Currently I am looking forward to do
        higher studies in Computer Science and work in Human Centric (Health,
        Fitness, Behaviours, Cognition or Social) Computing and other HCI
        technologies with application of Software Engineering and A.I. I have
        completed my degree of Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) from National
        Institute of Technology Durgapur, WB, India. I have decided to build my
        career in R&D and Tech. I love learning and exploring new things
        everyday. I develop softwares for fun and situational demands, and did
        some occasional designs too. In spare time I enjoy practicing
        guitar(can't say a player yet!), listening to music, binge watching,
        reading books or occasionally writing and taking photographs. Despite
        everything, life is never easy, so I am always trying to improve myself
        physically and mentally. Travelling and exploration is something I am
        looking forward in upcoming days.
        {/* I am a learner first, I fell in love with web technology and books in my
        early years. Currently I am a fresh B.Tech graduate from National
        Institute of Technology Durgapur, India. I love developing websites and
        their UX/UI and occationally do some designs in Photoshop and
        Illustrator. I also like taking nature photos, playing guitar, doing
        public speaking and writing sometimes. For me everyday is like a new
        opportunity to try something new, but life gets busy and messy
        sometimes.{"\n"}
        In personal life if you call it destination or something like landmark
        or goal, for me it would be travelling the world and then living in a
        peaceful countryside. */}
