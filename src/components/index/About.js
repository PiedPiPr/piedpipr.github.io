        Hello there, I am Protik Chanda, a tech enthusiast with a keen interest
        in computers, softwares, communication, well-being, education and
        innovation of any type overall. I have completed my degree of Bachelor
        of Technology (B.Tech) from National Institute of Technology Durgapur,
        WB, India. I have decided to build my career in R&D and Tech, possibly
        in AI and Software Industry. {/*Currently I am looking for research
        opportunities in Bioinformatics, ML/Deep Learning, eHealth and Human
        Centric (Health, Fitness, Behaviours, Cognition or Social) Computing .
        On the other hand HCI, eHealth and ML/DeepLearning realted studies
        are three of my academic interests for possible research.
         and with possible application of
        Software Engineering and ML, meanwhile I am also seeking immediate
        opportunity to join a company and gather hands-on industry experiences
        to advance mhy career.  */}
        I love learning and exploring new things everyday. I develop softwares
        for fun and situational demands, and did some occasional designs too. In
        spare time I enjoy practicing guitar(can't say a player yet!), listening
        to music, binge watching, reading books or occasionally writing and
        taking photographs. Despite everything, life is never easy, so I am
        always trying to improve myself physically and mentally. Travelling and
        exploration is something I am looking forward in upcoming days.
        {/* I am a learner first, I fell in love with web technology and books in my
        early years. Currently I am a fresh B.Tech graduate from National
        Institute of Technology Durgapur, India. I love developing websites and
        their UX/UI and occationally do some designs in Photoshop and
        Illustrator. I also like taking nature photos, playing guitar, doing
        public speaking and writing sometimes. For me everyday is like a new
        opportunity to try something new, but life gets busy and messy
        sometimes.{"\n"}
        In personal life if you call it destination or something like landmark
        or goal, for me it would be travelling the world and then living in a
        peaceful countryside. */}
